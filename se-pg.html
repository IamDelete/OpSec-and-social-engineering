        <h1>• Why would I care about social engineering?</h1>
        <p class="par-op">Imagine this , you are living a very good life , have a multitude of stocks and a lot of
            cryptocurrency, you get an email telling you that you need to change your password on your online wallet,
            you
            click the link, login and all of the sudden you don't have anything,
            this is called a phising attack and we will talk about it and diffrent ones in the next section.

        <h1>• Difrrent types of social engineering attacks</h1>
        <p class="par-op">There are almost endless attacks but here we will cover some of them and how they
            work:<br><br>
            -phising, this is the most known and dangerous attack.Here the targets needs to click a link that he thinks is
            a site, like Facebook or any oher social media website, then he logs in and all his credentials go to the
            attacker who was hoasting the clone website all along and that how he gets your password.To heast a local server you can youse the command <span>ngrok service start</span>in the linux terminal
            <br><br>
            -rubbe duck, in this attack the atacker gets he target to plug a usb into his pc, after that the usb is read
            as a keyboard and executes a number of commands to obtain something
            <br><br>
            The possibilies are never-ending , the only limit is the imaginination
