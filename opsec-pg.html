        <h1>• why would I care about my online privacy?</h1>
        <p class="par-op">In this day and age our privacy is constantly attacked by big companies who want our data but
            , "Why would I care?" ,
            I hear you asking , well how would it feel knowing you can't get a loan from the bank because they know you
            don't have a job without you even telling them.
            Big companies will always sell you data and pray to god that you are not doing anything midly dangerous on
            the internet because you will get caught very fast if you have bad Opsec
            something that we will cover later. And what is stopping hackers who want to steal from you (most of the
            time using phising attacks that we will cover in "social engineering")
            from learning about you personal life in a procces that is called Osint.

        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="sub-title">
        <h1>•Osint</h1>
        <p class="par-op">Osint is the procces of getting information on a specific target , "To defend from the enemy
            you must first
            know yourself and them" so we are going to look at
            on of the more simple tools to use is "Osintgram" that allows you to learn a lot about a person just from
            having their instargram account name.<br>
            **WE DO NOT CONDONE USING THIS TOOL FOR ANYTHING OTHER THEY EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES**
            <br>
            To run the program you first have to configures some files that we will not get into, but once we log into
            the account you can chose a target like @i_am.delete
            and we can learn a lot of information about them, here is a list with the commands that you can write:
            <br>

        <h1>• How can I become untrackeble?</h1>
        <p class="par-op">There is no true anonymity, if someone powerful enough wants to find you, they will.
            but that doesn't mean you can't make that harder:<br><br>
            -Get a good, trusted vpn. Most vpn's on the market are not as secure as they apper, but it will atleast add
            a middle-man if someone what to
            see your traffic
            <br><br>
            -If you can, use proxy chains. A lot of people (hackers mostly) got tracked down because they ddint hide
            their ip, I recommend using proxy-chains which act very similar to a vpn
            but you can set as many as you want
            <br><br>
            -Don't do anything dumb like saying you name on the internet, you addres , or anything from your personal
            life, this is how most hackers or wanted people where found
            , we will learn more about this in "Bad OpSec"
            <br><br>
            -One of the most common suggestions in this domain is having a diffrent laptop for all you dangerous
            activity online, but I think that is kind of going overboard
            and a live usb** should be enough (**- a live usb means a thumb drive that has a operating sistem running on
            it so you need only plug the usb in the pc to boot it up)
            my favourite os is kali linux but parrot works very well as well
            <br><br>
            -One of my personal recommendations is having two separate emails for your personal life (social media apps)
            and your internet life (any kind of site you dont want to know anything about you).

        <h1>• Bad Opsec </h1>
        <p class="par-op">In this section, we will talk about, you guessed it, 'Bad Opsec' and the people who have been
            caught doing illegal activities.
            <span>Dread Pirate Roberts / Ross Ulbricht:</span>This is one of the most infamous cases of bad Opsec. This
            guy ran a huge darknet marketplace where you could buy and sell almost anything. But, of course, pride got
            the better of him, so he started talking about it on a forum where he forgot to change his old name.
            Consequently, the FBI tracked the server with the same name to him. Along with a post about hiring a web
            developer and a 'cryptocurrency expert,' it was enough to get him caught.<br>
            <span> PomPomPurin:</span>A little background on this guy he was an active member of a darknet forum where
            leaked databases were sold. After that respective site got taken down by the FBI, he made a new one. The
            biggest mistake he made was talking to the admin about a leaked database in which he should have been a part
            of but wasn't. To prove that the database was not complete, he gave a 'random' example of an email address
            he knew for sure should have been in the leak but was not. Unfortunately, that email address turned out to
            be his own, with his full name. Obviously, after the database was taken by the feds, they had full access to
            that conversation, and that's how they got the full name of the admin of one of the biggest darknet forums
